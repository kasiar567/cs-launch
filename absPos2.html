   Apple is the common name for any tree of the genus Malus, of 
   the family Rosaceae. Apple trees grow in any of the temperate 
   areas of the world. Some apple blossoms are white, but most have 
   stripes or tints of rose. Some apple blossoms are bright red. 
   Apples have a firm and fleshy structure that grows from the 
   blossom. The colors of apples range from green to very dark red. 
   The wood of apple trees is fine-grained and hard. It is, 
   therefore, good for furniture construction. Apple trees have
   been grown for many centuries. They are propagated by grafting 
   because they do not reproduce themselves.
